Notes :

* Life cycle process:



1. Activity :
   -  add all intialise , click interface in oncreate block
   -  check view model null in to same condition
   -  keep mind on ondestroy call.
   -

2. Fragment:
   - add all intialise properties into saveinstance null
   - keep mind on ondestroy call.
   -  check view model null in to saveinstance null condition


   Project Overflow:

   -----------------HomeActivity-----------------  (frame layout)
                        |
   --------------HomeContainerFragment-----------  (view pager for 3 section)
                        |
   -----HomeFragment---OrderFragment---AccountFragment-----
             |          |                     |

        Homecontainer  Ordercontainer  Accountcontainer   (Every time you have to get ref of container and add in this three section)
         fragment       fragment          fragment


     * activity : fragment activity when we add fragment.
     * parent fragment: getparentframent() is work on nested fragment case02 not for case01 condition.

     CASE 01        CASE 02    -- Activity--
                                     |
      --Activity--               fragment
           |                         |
        fragment               nested fragment
           |                         |
        fragment               nested fragment

      Parent is Activity && Parent is Fragment not Activity

* IP and auth key:
  IP is for your device code and firebase code (device token)
  auth key: this is server auth

* Dp:
   - whenever you start ui take reference of 8 dp and start.
   - normally in between row : 5dp and hardly 8dp


* Data class:
    - If you define default null/""/arraylist in Dataclass then:
      if API replace this value by itself whether it null or not but
      if API have not key of that then default values would show.
